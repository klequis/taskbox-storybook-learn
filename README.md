# [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

Nothing here other than the example/tutorial from [Learn Storybook](https://www.learnstorybook.com/react/en/get-started).

## Run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/klequis/taskbox-storybook-learn.git
$ cd taskbox-storybook-learn
$ yarn
$ yarn run storybook
```

## My Thoughts
I did their [main tutorial](https://www.learnstorybook.com/react/en/get-started). Seems there is much more to Storybook.
- Well written tutorial and code works without troubleshooting
- Good for anything beyond very small app
- A plus for UI testing
- Appears well supported with active plug-in community
